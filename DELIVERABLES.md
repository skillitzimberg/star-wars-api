# DELIVERBlES

## Description

In web development, it’s critical that you work with a REST API (REpresentational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) and understand what it is. In this application you are going to get your first introduction to working with API’s.
In this application you are going to “pull” data from a free API that holds information about Star Wars characters and movies. This data is then going to be displayed to users of the application.
