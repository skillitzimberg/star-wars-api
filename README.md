## Summary

This the sixth app on my roadmap part of the Software Development Mastermind program. I'm learning a lot about code style - when, and when not, to use certain tools. Part of style is just about learning to keep it simple. You can refactor to more complex/different architectures or ideas later, but to start, just get the problem solved.

BTW, I did not do that here. This repo is ripe for refactoring and there are some things I'd like to implement that I just ran out of time for.

The expectations for the project are described in [DELIVERABLES](./DELIVERABLES.md).

The steps I took and other errata encountered while building are in [PLANNING](./PLANNING.md). I tried my best to have the commits track closely with this document.
